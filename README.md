# DIGITAL_RECOGNITION_CNN

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using deep learning. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to accurately classify digits (0-9).This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The model accurately classifies digits (0-9) from user input or images.
